## Description
Live preview: https://login-scree-seems-neat-itaxgaipp-gytandr.vercel.app/

Project was made as part of SeemsNeat test assignment.
Login form takes email and password, checks for input validity, makes fake authorization call, and lastly caches user credentials in LocalStorage for later session.

### Test requirements

- Design should look as close to the given design, as possible;
- Design must be responsive;
- App should work on modern browsers;
- Encouraged to use pre-processors for CSS, but that's optional;
- Email & password validation (not empty, valid email format);
- Make a _fake_ api call to login the user (only valid credentials of email: `frontend@isawesome.com`, password: `cool`);
- Store credentials to `localStorage`, so you wouldn't need to re-login later;
- Throw a greeting message if login was successful or user had credentials in `localStorage`;

## App was build using

- Next.js
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Redux
- SASS
